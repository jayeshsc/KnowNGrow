# KnowNGrow
KnowNGrow is a agri based project using IOT sensors (code of sensors not included). This project won the 2nd prize in SRM Hackathon 6.0 (Team Zeta)

This repo does not contain IOT sensor code. Using some specific data set we have made this project.

About project :
A device that measures the moisture levels in soil and lets the farmer know if he/she needs to further irrigate the crops.Further, a device will be integrated that lets the farmer know when to stop watering the crops by measuring the water output and the weather conditions.

About Sensor working
-> The Soil Moisture Sensor uses capacitance to measure dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium.
-> In soil, dielectric permittivity is a function of the water content. The sensor creates a voltage proportional to the dielectric permittivity, and therefore the water content of the soil.
